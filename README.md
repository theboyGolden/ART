# Tip Calculator

This simple Python program calculates the tip you should leave based on the meal cost and tip percentage you provide.

## How to Use

1. Run the program by executing `main()`.

2. You will be prompted to enter the following information:
   - The cost of the meal (e.g., "$50").
   - The tip percentage you'd like to leave (e.g., "15%").

3. The program will calculate the tip amount and display it for you.

## Functions

### `main()`

This is the main function that orchestrates the tip calculation process. It takes input for the meal cost and tip percentage, calculates the tip amount, and then displays it.

### `dollars_to_float(dollars)`

This function converts a dollar amount (e.g., "$50") provided as a string to a floating-point number. It removes the dollar sign and returns the numeric value.

### `percent_to_float(percent)`

This function converts a percentage (e.g., "15%") provided as a string to a floating-point number representing the decimal equivalent (e.g., 0.15).
